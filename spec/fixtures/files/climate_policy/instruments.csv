ECBC,Energy Conservation Building Code,ECBC.1,ECBC,"Under its statutory authority, the Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE) with the support of the Ministry of Power (MoP)  launched the Energy Conservation Building Code (ECBC) in 2007.  The purpose of this code is to provide minimum requirements for the energy-efficient design and construction of buildings.

 ECBC Version 2 was launched in June 2017 .ECBC 2017 was developed by BEE with technical support from United States Agency for International Development (USAID) under the U.S.-India bilateral Partnership to Advance Clean Energy – Deployment Technical Assistance (PACE-D TA) Program.
