The ECBC was developed by the International Institute for Energy Conservation (IIEC) under a contract from the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) as a part of the Energy Conservation and Commercialization (ECO) Project providing support to the (BEE) Action Plan. The purpose of this code is to provide minimum requirements for the energy-efficient design and construction of buildings.

 ECBC Version 2 was launched in June 2017 .ECBC 2017 was developed by BEE with technical support from United States Agency for International Development (USAID) under the U.S.-India bilateral Partnership to Advance Clean Energy â€“ Deployment Technical Assistance (PACE-D TA) Program.

Ministry of Urban Development (MoUD) also contributes to code implementation by introducing energy efficiency at city and building level through model building byelaws, smart cities mission, Central Public Works Department (CPWD) design guidelines, National Sustainable Habitat Mission (NSHM) etc

At the state level, the code notification is  facilitated by DoE or UDD, the code amendment responsibility lies with the energy department; UDD is responsible for amending Town and Country Planning (TCP) rules and regulation and building bye-laws to incorporate ECBC provisions once it is notified and amended at the state level. Once the code is notified at the state level, the enforcement will lie under the local government purview."
