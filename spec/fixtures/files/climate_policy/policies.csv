Buildings,ECBC,Policy Instrument,Energy Conservation Building Code,Bureau of Energy Efficiency and Ministry of Power,"Under its statutory authority, the Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE) with the support of the Ministry of Power (MoP)  launched the Energy Conservation Building Code (ECBC) in 2007. The ECBC was developed by the International Institute for Energy Conservation (IIEC) under a contract from the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) as a part of the Energy Conservation and Commercialization (ECO) Project providing support to the (BEE) Action Plan. The purpose of this code is to provide minimum requirements for the energy-efficient design and construction of buildings.

 ECBC Version 2 was launched in June 2017 .ECBC 2017 was developed by BEE with technical support from United States Agency for International Development (USAID) under the U.S.-India bilateral Partnership to Advance Clean Energy – Deployment Technical Assistance (PACE-D TA) Program.
",Yes,"At the national level, ECBC development and update responsibility lie with central government. Ministry of Urban Development (MoUD) also contributes to code implementation by introducing energy efficiency at city and building level through model building byelaws, smart cities mission, Central Public Works Department (CPWD) design guidelines, National Sustainable Habitat Mission (NSHM) etc

At the state level, the code notification is  facilitated by DoE or UDD, the code amendment responsibility lies with the energy department; UDD is responsible for amending Town and Country Planning (TCP) rules and regulation and building bye-laws to incorporate ECBC provisions once it is notified and amended at the state level. Once the code is notified at the state level, the enforcement will lie under the local government purview.",Implemented,Facing some barriers in policy implementation,yes,"UNDP-2012, IER2017 "
Energy,NSM,Policy,Jawaharlal Nehru National Solar Mission,Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE),"he Mission has adopted a three phase approach. The first phase (2010-2013) was designed to focus on capturing the low-hanging options in solar thermal; promoting off-grid systems to serve populations without access to commercial energy and modest capacity addition in grid-based systems. In the second (2013-2017) and third (2017-2022) phases, capacity will be aggressively ramped up to create conditions for scaled-up and competitive solar energy penetration in the country. To achieve this, the mission targets that by year 2022 it wilL

* Create an enabling policy framework for the deployment of  100,000 MW of solar power

* Create favorable conditions for solar manufacturing capability, particularly solar thermal for indigenous production and market leadership

* Promote programmes for off grid applications reaching 2,000 MW

* Achieve 20 million sq. meters solar thermal collector area

* Deploy 20 million solar lighting systems for rural areas
",yes,"1. A Mission Steering Group, chaired by the Minister for New and Renewable Energy and composed of representatives from all relevant Ministries and other stakeholders, will oversee the implementation of the National Solar Mission. The Mission Steering Group will be fully empowered to approve various schemes/ projects/ policies and the related financial norms for all schemes covered under the National Solar Mission(NSM). The Mission Steering group will also authorize any modifications/deviations in the norms on ongoing schemes.

2. A Mission Executive Committee, chaired by Secretary, Ministry of New and Renewable Energy, will periodically review the progress of implementation of the projects approved by the Mission Steering Group.

3. An empowered Solar Research Council headed by an eminent scientist will advise the Mission on all R&D, technology and capacity building related matters. In addition, Industry Advisory Council will advise the Mission on all matters relating to industrial development, technology transfer/absorption/joint ventures, incentives and investment related matters.

4. A Mission Director, with the rank of an Additional Secretary, would head the Mission secretariat and be responsible for day to day functioning and also achieving the goals laid out in a time bound manner. The Mission Secretariat would have Joint secretary/ Scientist G level officers including other scientists, experts and consultants.",Implemented,Facing some barriers in policy implementation,yes,IER2017
